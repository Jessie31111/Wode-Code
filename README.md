Subject: Proposed Strategies and Considerations for Enhancing Trading Performance

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss some ideas and considerations regarding our trading strategies, specifically focusing on optimizing trading performance. I have outlined a few points below for us to consider:

1. Haircut Limitations:
   It appears that using haircuts is limited in its effectiveness. Since the total buffer does not grow, even if we allocate the extra to the client without any haircut, it would be equivalent to providing the client with the version without a haircut. Therefore, it may be worth exploring alternative approaches that can yield more significant benefits.

2. Realism of Decreasing Average Volume:
   It is worth noting that attempting to decrease the average volume may be unrealistic. We cannot easily influence clients to abstain from trading, as it is ultimately their decision. As long as clients continue to trade, it is challenging to reduce average volume since fewer trades directly translate to a decrease in average volume.

3. Focus on Increasing Intraday Holdings:
   Considering the constraints mentioned above, it might be more feasible to concentrate on increasing intraday holdings. I have outlined a few potential approaches for us to explore:

   a. Incentivizing Clients to Buy More:
      We can explore ways to encourage clients to increase their buying activity. This could involve offering attractive incentives or benefits for larger buying volumes. By motivating clients to buy more, we can potentially increase intraday holdings.

   b. Restricting Selling Activities:
      Another approach could involve implementing restrictions on selling activities. For example, we could require clients to maintain a certain portion of their holdings from the start of the day (SOD) until end of day (EOD). However, it is essential to consider the potential impact on client satisfaction and evaluate whether such restrictions align with their trading objectives.

   c. Introducing Dummy Inventory:
      This approach involves using dummy inventory to artificially increase buying and selling activities. For instance, we could introduce a dummy buy followed by a sell, resulting in a net increase in trading volume. It is important to note that this approach may not be suitable for low touch desks, and further evaluation is required to assess its viability.

Additionally, if the buffer reaches a certain threshold, we could enter a state where clients are temporarily restricted from placing orders within the previous 0 to 9-1 interval. This approach aims to either limit the increase in turnover or break the growth rate of maximum positions and turnover.

In addition to the above discussion points, I have developed a comprehensive simulation tool using Python that can further analyze and evaluate the proposed strategies. The tool incorporates various parameters and factors to provide detailed insights into trading performance.

I believe that implementing these strategies and utilizing the simulation tool can help us optimize our trading performance. I would appreciate your thoughts and feedback on these ideas. Please let me know if you would like to explore them further or if you have any additional suggestions.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to discussing these strategies in more detail.

Best regards,
