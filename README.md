Subject: Request for Five-Year Rebalance Data for Index Project

Dear [Index Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request the five-year rebalance data for our upcoming index project. As the PT team is currently working on this initiative, having access to the historical rebalance data is crucial for our analysis and decision-making process.

To ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of our project, we kindly ask for the following information:

1. Detailed rebalance data for the past five years, including the dates and specific actions taken during each rebalance.
2. Any supporting documentation or explanations regarding the methodology or criteria used for rebalancing the index.

Having access to this historical data will enable us to thoroughly assess the index's performance, evaluate any changes made over time, and make informed decisions regarding our project's implementation.

We understand that this request may require some effort on your part, and we genuinely appreciate your support and cooperation. Please let us know if there are any specific procedures or guidelines we need to follow in order to obtain the requested data.

If there are any concerns or questions regarding our request, or if you require additional information from our team, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We value your expertise and input, and we are committed to creating a successful index project.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. We look forward to receiving the rebalance data and any accompanying documentation at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
