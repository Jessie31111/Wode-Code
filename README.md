Subject: Request for Additional Data to Proceed with the Project

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to provide you with an update regarding our evaluation of the three websites you shared with us. After a thorough examination, we have concluded that the disclosed information is insufficient to complete the project successfully.

During our analysis of the annual reports for the respective funds, we managed to gather the following data:

1. Total value of investments
2. Breakdown by production or sector
3. Overall return

However, we encountered a limitation in our findings. Unfortunately, we were unable to locate detailed weighting within each investment category. This lack of specific information poses a challenge and makes it impractical for us to proceed further without a clearer understanding of the allocation of investments within each sector.

Therefore, we kindly request your assistance in providing us with additional data that includes the detailed weighting of investments within each sector. This information is crucial for us to accurately assess the feasibility and potential outcomes of the project.

We truly appreciate your understanding and collaboration in addressing this matter. Should you require any further clarification or if there are alternative solutions we can explore, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

Thank you for your attention to this request. We look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
